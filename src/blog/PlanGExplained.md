Medicare Supplement Plan G is a type of Medicare Supplement insurance plan that is designed to help cover some of the out-of-pocket costs associated with Original Medicare (Parts A and B). Medicare Supplement plans are also known as Medigap plans because they fill in the gaps left by Original Medicare.

Plan G is one of the more comprehensive Medigap plans available, second only to Plan F. Plan G covers all of the same benefits as Plan F, except for the Part B deductible. This means that Plan G will cover 100% of your Part B coinsurance and copayments after you meet your annual deductible.

Some of the benefits that Plan G covers include:

    Part A coinsurance and hospital costs
    Part B coinsurance or copayment
    Blood (first 3 pints)
    Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayment
    Skilled nursing facility care coinsurance
    Part A deductible
    Foreign travel emergency (up to plan limits)

Plan G is a popular choice among Medicare beneficiaries who want comprehensive coverage but are willing to pay the Part B deductible out of pocket.
