      <p class="cs-text">
        Since 2010, we have worked dilligently to make sure our clients have the best insurance available for their situation. Whether it's Mortgage Protection, Whole Life, Accidental, Term Life, Universal Index, individual or family health insurance, Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage, Part D, or Dental, we will shop the market for the best available plan in your area so you don't have to. 
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        In many cases, you may already have the best insurance plan. We offer a free review of your current benefits to make sure that you aren't paying too much and that your coverage is still the best policy for your needs. What may have been the best insurance plan earlier in your life may no longer be a great insurance plan. However, many times we find that the exact same coverage is available at a lower cost. Either way, you won't have to worry about which plan is best, or if there is a great policy available in your area. Call us now to schedule a free consultation at (512) 524-9826.

      <h2 class="cs-title">Medicare Supplements Are Standardized</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Since 1992, the U.S. Government has mandated that all Medicare Supplements be standardized. That means it does not matter which company you choose for your plan. The coverage is guaranteed to be exactly the same. Once you are on the phone with one of our specialists, you can rest assured you aren't paying too much for your coverage.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        And the best part is, in addition to saving money every month on your premium, you do not have to change doctors, or wonder if you are in network. Medicare supplements are nationwide and work exactly the same, no matter what. Let's make sure you aren't paying too much.
