      <p class="cs-text">
        Since 2010, we have worked dilligently to make sure our clients have the best insurance available for their situation. Whether it's Mortgage Protection, Whole Life, Accidental, Term Life, Universal Index, individual or family health insurance, Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage, Part D, or Dental, we will shop the market for the best available plan in your area so you don't have to. There is never a charge for our services.  
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        In many cases, you may already have the best insurance plan. On every appointment, we review your current benefits to make sure that you aren't paying too much and that your coverage is still the best policy for your needs. What may have been the best insurance plan earlier in your life may no longer be a great insurance plan. However, many times we find that the exact same coverage is available at a lower cost. Either way, you won't have to worry about which plan is best, or if there is a great policy available in your area. Call now to make sure you aren't paying too much! (512) 524-9826.

      <h2 class="cs-title">Medicare Supplements Are Standardized</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Since 1992, the U.S. Government has mandated that all Medicare Supplements be standardized. That means it does not matter which company you choose for your plan. The coverage is guaranteed to be exactly the same. In many states, you can even change plans with no health questions!
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        The best part is, in addition to saving money every month on your premium, you do not have to change doctors, or wonder if you are in network. Medicare supplements are nationwide and work exactly the same, no matter what. Let's make sure you aren't paying too much. Don't worry about broker fees or any charge for our services. Should we find you a better plan and/or a lower premium, we are paid by the insurance company, not you. Call now to review. (512) 524-9826
