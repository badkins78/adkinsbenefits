        <h2 class="cs-title">Additional Information About Medicare Part B</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
            To enroll in Medicare Part B, you must be 65 years or older, or have a qualifying disability. You can enroll in Part B during your initial enrollment period, which is a seven-month period that begins three months before the month you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and ends three months after the month you turn 65. If you do not enroll during your initial enrollment period, you may be subject to a late enrollment penalty.
            </p>
        <p class="cs-text">
            Part B is funded through a combination of monthly premiums paid by beneficiaries and general revenues. Beneficiaries are responsible for paying a monthly premium for Part B, which is determined by their income. Additionally, beneficiaries may be responsible for paying deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance fees for services and supplies covered under Part B.
        </p>        
        <p class="cs-text">
            It's important to note that while Part B covers many medical costs, it does not cover all costs associated with medical care. You may be responsible for paying deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance fees. Additionally, some services may not be covered under Part B and may require additional out-of-pocket costs.
