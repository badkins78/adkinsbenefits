      <h2 class="cs-title">What Is Medicare A?</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Medicare is a government-funded health insurance program in the United States that provides coverage for individuals who are 65 years or older, or younger with certain disabilities or conditions. Medicare has four parts: Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part D. In this response, we will focus on Medicare Part A.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">      
        Medicare Part A, also known as hospital insurance, provides coverage for inpatient hospital stays, skilled nursing facilities, hospice care, and some home health care. Here is a detailed explanation of each benefit:

        <h2 class="cs-title">Inpatient Hospital Stays</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
            Inpatient hospital stays: Part A covers hospital stays of up to 90 days per benefit period. A benefit period begins the day you're admitted to the hospital and ends when you haven't received inpatient hospital care for 60 consecutive days. If you are admitted to the hospital for more than 90 days in a benefit period, you will have to pay a coinsurance fee.</p>
        <h2 class="cs-title">Skilled Nursing Facilities</h2> 
        <p class="cs-text">
            Skilled nursing facilities: If you require skilled nursing care after a hospital stay, Part A will cover up to 100 days per benefit period. To be eligible, you must have a qualifying hospital stay of at least three days and need skilled nursing care for a condition that was treated during your hospital stay.</p>
        <h2 class="cs-title">Hospice Care</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
            Hospice care: Part A covers hospice care for individuals who have a life expectancy of six months or less. Hospice care can be provided in your home, a hospice facility, or a hospital.</p>
        <h2 class="cs-title">Home Health Care</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
            Home health care: Part A covers home health care services such as skilled nursing care, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. To be eligible, you must be homebound and require skilled care on a part-time or intermittent basis.

        <h2 class="cs-title">Additional Information About Medicare Part A</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
            Medicare Part A is funded through payroll taxes that individuals and their employers pay during their working years. Most individuals are automatically enrolled in Part A when they turn 65 and are eligible for Medicare. If you are not automatically enrolled, you can sign up during certain enrollment periods.
            </p>
        <p class="cs-text">
            It's important to note that while Part A covers many hospital-related costs, it does not cover all costs associated with hospital stays, skilled nursing facilities, hospice care, and home health care. You may be responsible for paying deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance fees.
