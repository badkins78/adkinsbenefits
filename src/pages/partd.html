      <p class="cs-text">
        Medicare Part D is a prescription drug program that is available to Medicare beneficiaries. It is designed to provide coverage for prescription drugs to individuals who are enrolled in Medicare. Medicare Part D is a voluntary program, which means that you are not required to enroll, but if you do not enroll when you are first eligible, you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty.

        <h2 class="cs-title">There are two ways to get Medicare Part D coverage:</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
            Stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs): These plans are offered by private insurance companies and provide prescription drug coverage for those who have Original Medicare (Part A and Part B).</p>        
        <p class="cs-text">
            Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans (MAPDs): These plans are offered by private insurance companies that contract with Medicare to provide Medicare benefits, including prescription drug coverage.</p>        
        <p class="cs-text">
            In both cases, you will pay a monthly premium for the plan, as well as any copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles for the prescription drugs that you receive.</p>

        <h2 class="cs-title">Additional Information About Medicare Part D</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
            Each Medicare Part D plan has a formulary, which is a list of drugs that the plan covers. The formulary will specify how much you will pay for each drug based on its tier. Tier 1 drugs are typically generic drugs and have the lowest copayment, while Tier 4 drugs are typically specialty drugs and have the highest copayment.
            </p>
        <p class="cs-text">
            It is important to note that there is a coverage gap in Medicare Part D, also known as the "donut hole." Once you and your plan have spent a certain amount on prescription drugs for the year, you will be responsible for a larger portion of the cost until you reach catastrophic coverage. In 2022, the coverage gap begins once you and your plan have spent $4,430 on covered drugs, and it ends once you have spent a total of $7,050 out-of-pocket.
        </p>        
        <p class="cs-text">
            In summary, Medicare Part D is a program that provides prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries through private insurance companies. There are two ways to get Medicare Part D coverage, and each plan has a formulary and a coverage gap.
