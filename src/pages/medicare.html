      <h2 class="cs-title">What Is Medicare?</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        <a href="https://www.medicare.gov">Medicare</a> is the federal health insurance plan for people 65 and older, people younger than 65 with disabilities, and people of any age with End-Stage Renal Disease. This coverage is the same throughout all 50 states. There are no 'networks' to be concerned with. As long as the provider accepts Medicare, you can be treated anywhere in the United States.
      <p class="cs-text">
        <a href="https://www.cms.gov">CMS(the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)</a> reported that as of October 2021, there were nearly 64 million people on Medicare. The United States Census Bureau says that by 2030, all Baby Boomers will be age 65 or older. This is a significant portion of the population. This is why it is important that Medicare and Medicare Supplements be very comprehensive and regulated, to ensure that Medicare recipients are protected.</p>

        <p class="cs-text">
          People on Medicare typically enroll in a Medicare Supplement plan(also known as a MediGap plan) to help with the costs not covered by Medicare. For many years, the Medicare Supplement Plan F was the most comprehensive Medicare Supplement available. In 2020, CMS began to phase out the MediGap Plan F. For anyone new to Medicare as of January 1, 2020, the Medicare Supplement Plan F is no longer available to purchase. However, anyone that was ever eligible to purchase MediGap Plan F would always be able to keep their Plan F if they want or to purchase a Plan F from any company that offers it.</p>
  
        <p class="cs-text">
          For those new to Medicare since 2020, the best Medicare Supplement Plan available now is the Medicare Supplement Plan G. This plan is very similar to the Medicare Supplement Plan F. The only difference between these two Medicare Supplements is that the MediGap Plan F pays the annual Medicare Part B deductible and the Medicare Supplement Plan G does not. This is why the Plan G is the best Medicare Supplement available. </p>
