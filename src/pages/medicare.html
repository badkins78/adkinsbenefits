      <h2 class="cs-title">What Is Medicare?</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        <a href="https://www.medicare.gov">Medicare</a> is the federal health insurance plan for people 65 and older, people younger than 65 with disabilities, and people of any age with End-Stage Renal Disease. This coverage is the same throughout all 50 states. There are no 'networks' to be concerned with. As long as the provider accepts Medicare, you can be treated anywhere in the United States.
      <p class="cs-text">
        <a href="https://www.cms.gov">CMS(the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)</a> reported that as of October 2021, there were nearly 64 million people on and eligible for Medicare. The United States Census Bureau says that by 2030, all Baby Boomers will be age 65 or older. This is a significant portion of the population. This is why it is important that Medicare and Medicare Supplements be very comprehensive and regulated, to ensure that Medicare recipients are protected.</p>

        <h2 class="cs-title">What is Medicare Supplement Insurance(Medigap)?</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
          People on Medicare typically enroll in a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Supplement plan(also known as a MediGap plan) to help with the costs not covered by Medicare. To enroll in a plan like this, you must be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. For many years, the Plan F was the most comprehensive supplement available. In 2020, CMS began to phase out the MediGap Plan F. For anyone new to Medicare as of January 1, 2020, the Plan F is no longer available to purchase. However, anyone that was ever eligible to purchase MediGap Plan F would always be able to keep their Plan F if they want or to purchase a Plan F from any company that offers it.</p>
  
        <p class="cs-text">
          For those new to Medicare since 2020, the highest level of coverage available now is Plan G. This plan is very similar to the Plan F. The only difference between these two health plans is that the MediGap Plan F pays the annual Medicare Part B deductible and the Plan G does not. Also, like the Plan F, the Plan G is guaranteed renewable for life, as long as you pay your monthy premium. This is why the Plan G is the best health plan available. We can help you find a great rate for and buy a Medigap plan. </p>

        <h2 class="cs-title">Initial Election Period</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
          When you turn 65 you become eligible for Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B, as long as you have worked and paid into Medicare for at least 40 quarters, or 10 years. At this time, you Part A and Part B will become effective the first day of the month that you turn 65. If your birthday is on the first of the month, your effective dates would be the first day of the prior month. The 3 months prior to your effective date, the effective month, and the 3 months after are called your Initial Election Period. During this time you can choose to enroll in a Medigap plan, a Medicare Advantage plan and a Part D Prescription Drug plan. 
        </p>
        <p class="cs-text">
          During your Initial Election Period, you can select these plans without worrying about your pre-existing health conditions. There is no underwriting, and you can choose any plan offered in your area without asking health questions. These plans are optional, but if you don't choose coverage during this period, you generally have to wait until the Annual Election Period(AEP), to select a Part D Drug plan and Medicare Advantage plan, and you could be penalized for being eligible for coverage, but not having it. If you want to enroll in a Medigap plan, you would have to answer health related questions, and the insurance company could decline to issue your policy based on your medical history or certain prescription drug use. Let us know if you have any questions about these enrollment periods, late enrollment periods or to see if you qualify.

    <h2 class="cs-title">Picking A Medigap Plan</h2>
    <p class="cs-text">
      Since Medigap plans are standardized, once you understand how the plan works, you understand how it works with every insurance company that offers it, in every state where the coverage is offered. The only difference is price. This makes it easy to choose your coverage. At Adkins Benefits, we only work with the top rated carriers, like Mutual of Omaha, United Healthcare(AARP), Humana, Aetna and many more. When you enroll with one of our agents, you never have to worry about dealing with the insurance company. We act as your advocate and can be the go-between if you move, change bank accounts or lose your insurance card.
    </p>    
    <p class="cs-text">
      Most Medigap plans guarantee no rate increases for the first 12 months of coverage. After this 12 month period, you can expect a rate adjustment at least once a year. This could happen on your policy anniversary date, or your birth month. Generally the rates for these plans remain stable for the first 3-4 years, but after that it's a good idea to give us a call to make sure that your rate is still competitive in your area. These plans are generally more expensive than Medicare Advantage plans, but the coverage is very easy to understand, and there is no need to worry about networks and copays(for Plan G). The good news about working with us at Adkins Benefits is that if your rate goes up, you don't have to start the process all over and find a new agent you can trust. We do not work for any insurance carrier. We are an independent brokerage, which means we work for you! We can move your policy from one insurance company to another, reducing your monthly premium, while keeping your coverage exactly the same.

      <h2 class="cs-title">Annual Election Period</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        In the fall, from October 15 through December 7 is your Annual Election Period. During this time you can make a change to your Part D Prescription Drug Plan and/or Enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan. These changes would become effective the following January 1. This is a good time to call in and talk to your agent at Adkins Benefits. We can search all of the plans in your area and, based on your specific needs, recommend a plan customized to you. Some people may need a really comprehensive Prescription Drug plan, while others may want to simply enroll in the least expensive, just to make sure they aren't penalized. We will take a list of all of your prescription medications, dosages and quantities and look at the pharmacies in your area, including mail-order options, and then compare all of the Part D plans in your area to make sure that your total out-of-pocket cost for the following year is as low as possible. This can be quite confusing depending on how many prescriptions you take. Let us take care of the details, and you can relax, knowing you have the best coverage for you specific situation.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        For some of our clients here at Adkins Benefits, a better solution to their healthcare needs is a Medicare Advantage plan. These plans are sometimes referred to as MA plans, MADP plans or D-SNP plans. These plans typically have lower monthly premiums, or none at all. They can also inclued additional benefits like Dental, Vision and Hearing coverage. In certain situations, you may even qualify for a lower Part B premium, or no Part B premium at all! This generaly depends on your financial situation. In some cases, you might even be eligible for extra help with your prescription drug costs, help paying for over-the-counter health and wellness items, or even a flex card, which can be used to help pay for groceries, utilities and transportation. We can help look at all of your needs and make sure that you are receiving all of the additional benefits available to you.
