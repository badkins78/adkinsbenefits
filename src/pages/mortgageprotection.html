      <h2 class="cs-title">What is Mortgage Protection Insurance?</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Mortgage protection insurance is a type of insurance policy that is designed to help you pay your mortgage if you become unable to work due to illness, injury, or disability. The policy will typically pay out a monthly benefit for a set period of time (often up to 2 years) to help cover your mortgage payments until you are able to return to work. Some mortgage protection policies may also pay off your entire mortgage balance in the event of your death.
      </p>

        <p class="cs-text">
        Mortgage protection insurance is different from mortgage insurance, which is a type of insurance that protects the lender in the event that you default on your mortgage payments. Mortgage protection insurance is designed to protect you as the borrower and help ensure that you can continue to make your mortgage payments even if you experience an unexpected loss of income.

        <h2 class="cs-title">What is Medicare Supplement Insurance(Medigap)?</h2>
        <p class="cs-text">
          People on Medicare typically enroll in a Medicare Supplement plan(also known as a MediGap plan) to help with the costs not covered by Medicare. To enroll in a supplement plan like this, you must be enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. For many years, the Medicare Supplement Plan F was the most comprehensive supplement available. In 2020, CMS began to phase out the MediGap Plan F. For anyone new to Medicare as of January 1, 2020, the Plan F is no longer available to purchase. However, anyone that was ever eligible to purchase MediGap Plan F would always be able to keep their Plan F if they want or to purchase a Plan F from any company that offers it.</p>
  
        <p class="cs-text">
          For those new to Medicare since 2020, the best Medicare Supplement Plan available now is Plan G. This plan is very similar to the Plan F. The only difference between these two supplements is that the MediGap Plan F pays the annual Medicare Part B deductible and the Plan G does not. Also, like the Plan F, the Plan G is guaranteed renewable for life, as long as you pay your monthy premium. This is why the Plan G is the best Medicare Supplement available. We can help you find a great rate for and buy a Medigap plan. </p>
