      <p>
        I want to thank you so much for helping me out 7 years ago when I needed a supplement insurance. I was so confused didn’t know where to go or what to do. You helped me get a great insurance at a great rate! It pays for everything and low rates. I am impressed with the fact after all these years you reached out to me to see if I needed a change. We went over my insurance and told me it was still okay for me. I really don’t know what I would have done if it were not for you. Thank you again for all your knowledge and help. I recommend you to all my friends and family, heck even people I don’t know.....

        Bill has helped me with my Medicare insurance supplement since i have been on Medicare. He is easy to reach by phone and totally explains every thing in detail. He always helps me find the best plan and of coarse the best price on my policy. Believe me, you should shop your insurance with Bill Adkins. He really takes good care of me and ALWAYS has the best price on any type Medical insurance you may need. He is very trust worthy .

        Bill has been my insurance broker for seven years, and it is no exaggeration to state that he is the best. He always looks out for my interests, finding the best plans for the best price, and I have recommended him to many of my friends, all of whom have nothing but good to say about doing business with him. I'd give him ten stars if that were an option.

          Bill Adikins was a life-saver for us. He was able to assemble an insurance solution for my in a day and it was very cost-effective and comprehensive. His knowledge of the industry was very impressive. I would recommend him to anyone for the supplemental Medicare insurance needs..

    Bill Adkins, a benefits specialist, is just that. He was great to talk with and helped us find the right insurance for us. If anyone needs to update their insurance or just check it out to see if what they pay is compatible, you should speak with Bill.
